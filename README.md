# Stellaris Dashboard

The Stellaris Dashboard reads your Stellaris save files while you play the game and shows detailed information and statistics about your playthrough. 

**Important**: This program only works for **singleplayer** games. Ironman mode should work. Loading old save files is not explicitly supported and may break the program.

# Features

There are two components: A **timeline dashboard** which shows many graphs (30+) of game statistics and a historical map of the galaxy, and an **event ledger** listing the events that define your game's history. You can browse through the event ledger by clicking the links, allowing you to view the history of a specific country, leader, system, or war. For each war, a combat log of major fleet battles and planet invasions is shown.

Subscribing to [the mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1466534202) on the Steam workshop makes the dashboard  directly available in-game through the integrated browser, which can be accessed by the help icon in the bottom right of the Stellaris UI, or with the keyboard shortcut `ALT-B`.

For game balance and immersion, only some information about AI empires is shown by default. If you want, you can also configure the program to show everything in the settings menu.

Screenshots are available in the mod's Steam workshop page: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1466534202 

# Installation

If you experience any problems, please start [a new discussion topic in the steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/discussions/1466534202).

Before following the OS-specific instructions below, subscribe to the browser mod [in the Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1466534202). Remember to activate the mod [in the Stellaris Launcher](https://imgur.com/g7XeZIz). You can open the in-game internet browser by clicking on the help icon in the lower right, or with the shortcut `ALT-B`. The dashboard can then be accessed with the buttons in the top right corner of the browser window. 


### Windows

  1. Download the latest build of the dashboard [from github](https://github.com/eliasdoehne/stellaris-dashboard/releases).
  2. Extract the zip archive to a location of your choice.
  3. Run `stellarisdashboard.exe`.

### Linux
 
  1. [Get Python 3](https://www.python.org/). The Dashboard requires version 3.6 or later.
  2. Download the latest release of the dashboard [from github](https://github.com/eliasdoehne/stellaris-dashboard/releases) ("Download Source Code (zip)") and extract the archive to a location of your choice.
  3. Open a terminal in that folder and run `python -m venv env` to create a virtual environment. Depending on what Python versions are installed in your system, you may have to replace `python` with the more explicit `python3.7` or similar. Once you activate the virtualenvironment in the next step, this should not matter anymore. 
  4. Run `source env/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.
  5. Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.
  6. To start the program, run `python -m stellarisdashboard` from the main directory (remember to first activate your virtual environment!).

These instructions should also work on Mac OS X, although I cannot test this. Mac users should also follow the Cython instructions in the next section to improve the performance of the program.

### Cython
This section is only important if you see an error message mentioning Cython.

The dashboard uses a Cython extension to accelerate the processing of save files. Binaries are included for some common platforms, but you can also build it yourself:

  1. Install a C compiler and install cython following the instructions at http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html
  2. Install the dashboard using the instructions above.

The program should still run even with the Cython error, but it will be much slower.

# Other information

## Hardware Requirements

The Hardware requirements depend on several factors galaxy size, your game speed and the autosave frequency.

If you have a quad-core CPU or better, I suggest allowing 2 threads in the settings menu. You can also change the "Only read every n-th save" option in the settings menu. For example, if you set it to 3, the dashboard will only read every third save, allowing you to keep monthly autosaves, while the dashboard will only read one of them per quarter.

For disk space, the database itself should require a few megabytes per in-game decade. The data for each game is stored in a separate database in your output folder (for example `output/db/unitednationsofearth6_1643184243.db`), which is named by the game ID, so you can delete them individually.

Stellaris always deletes the oldest autosave so only the most recent files are kept. If you plan a long game and want to be able to re-generate the database later (in case I release an update or if something goes wrong), you need to continually backup the save files yourself. This requires more disk space for all the save files, but allows you to rebuild the full database at any point using the command `stellarisdashboardcli parse-saves --save-path *path to your save_backup*`. If you do this, I recommend only backing up auto-save files, as the saves are processed in alphabetical order, and the dashboard expects to process them in order of increasing in-game time.


## Update notifications
Since the dashboard is still a work in progress, I release updates fairly regularly. If a new version of the dashboard program is released I also release an update in the Steam workshop, and you will then see a notification in the dashboard UI. 

This notification is shown because the workshop mod contains a version ID, allowing the dashboard to compare its own version to this ID. The dashboard program itself does not send any data. It only runs locally on your computer. You can disable update notifications in the settings menu.

## Why a separate program?
The dashboard is quite complex and to my knowledge, making a mod with these features by editing the game files would be impossible, or at least much more difficult. This is why you have to run the external program to use the dashboard.

## Mod compatibility

The dashboard may or may not work with other mods, it is developed with the vanilla game in mind. If you experience a problem with a modded game, you can still let me know: If the mod is quite popular and the problem is easily fixed, I will take a look.

## Known Limitations

  1. Loading save files out of order (with respect to in-game time) is not supported, and will probably screw up the database.
  2. Renaming things in-game after they have been added to the database might cause issues.
   
If an error occurs, please try restarting the dashboard program. If you run into problems that don't go away after restarting, please start a new discussion topic [in the Steam workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/discussions/1466534202).
